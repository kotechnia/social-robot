Deep convolutional neural network models may take days or even weeks to train on very large datasets. A way to short-cut this process is to re-use the model weights from pre-trained models that were developed for standard computer vision benchmark datasets, such as the ImageNet image recognition tasks. Top performing models can be downloaded and used directly, or integrated into a new model for your own computer vision problems. In this post, you will discover how to use transfer learning when developing convolutional neural networks for computer vision applications.
